# MyFirstKivyApp

Well as the the repo name says... this is my first GUI application written in Kivy!
Not bad for a first timer who is lazy when it comes to front end :)
I did not hash those password when storing them in the database so incase you want to use it for your reference(idk why someone would, but yeah) make sure you add that feature by yourself
Uhhh, thats it. The code is Pretty straight forward.
